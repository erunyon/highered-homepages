# Higher Education Homepages

For years I've performed performance analysis on a list of independently curated highered responsive websites. I've recently wanted to expand that list to include many more highered homepages.

## Creating the list

Started with 1,930 urls from [Search Engines Marketer's List of University and College Websites](https://searchenginesmarketer.com/company/resources/university-college-list/) (thanks [@SEOMInteractive](https://twitter.com/SEOMInteractive)!).

- Normalized urls (add https, www, etc. where applicable)
- Removed 61 dead urls
- Removed 12 with messages they were shutting down (going out of business)
- Removed 4 `.com` urls
- Removed 82 non-qualifying urls (see Requirements below)
- Added 83 from [my RWD list](https://erikrunyon.com/highered-rwd-directory/) that were missing from SEM's list
- Subsequent additions and removals

## Requirements

First and foremost, it's possible that not every url in this list meets these criteria. It was a lot of sites to comb through, and I'm sure I missed some.

- Must be an accredited, degree granting higher education institution.
- Must be the front-most url for a university, college, or campus. This excludes mobile versions, but may include campuses that fall under a larger umbrella.
- Cannot be a school or medical facility that exists under a parent university (that includes business schools, law schools, etc.).
- Must not be a specialty school such as chiropractic or cosmetology.

Requirements are subject to change and are up for debate.

## Contributing
